hello, to use this interface:

open sketch in arduino and try compiling, if it says some file doesnt exist go to Sketch > add file and do it manually

After uploading the arduino sketch you also have to update the html/css files by hitting Tools > ESPxx Sketch Data Upload

when the robot turns on wait for the humming to stop, thats the boot sequence i believe

connect to the espXX wifi (pw = "askyourselfnospaces")

go to your web browser and type in 192.168.4.1

if the css doesn't load just expand the left most textbox using the drag icon in the lower right

hit the heart button in the middle to start/stop data transmission

ez sensor data
